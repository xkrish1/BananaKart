# Vibe Kanban Workspace

This directory is a clean slate for experimenting with a Codex-powered Kanban experience.

## Getting Started

1. Launch ChatGPT (Plus) or another Codex-capable assistant.
2. Share this repository path and describe the board you want to build.
3. Use iterative prompts to scaffold:
   - Board data structures (columns, cards, tags)
   - API or filesystem persistence (e.g., `boards/` folder)
   - UI mockups or integrations if needed

## Suggested Layout

- `boards/` – JSON or markdown exports of each Kanban board
- `scripts/` – automation helpers generated via Codex
- `docs/` – planning notes, prompt history, and workflow agreements

Create these subdirectories as your workflow evolves.

## Next Steps

- Capture your first prompt session log in `docs/`
- Define your board schema in `boards/`
- Let Codex generate scripts to sync or visualize the board

Enjoy building the Vibe Kanban system!
